## How to run

1. Clone this repository
2. You don't need to configure the API key as I've already set mine. However, if you prefer to use your own API key, simply edit the `apiKey` parameter in the `TheMovieDbConstants` class, located in the file `lib/core/constants/constants.dart`, replacing it with your API key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Run `flutter run`

## Suggested improvements:

- Add the TV series section; on the main page, two additional chips could be created, "Top Rated (TV)" and "Popular (TV)", along with that, it would be necessary to simply replicate the code used to display these categories in movies and convert the MovieEntity in something like MediaEntity and use it for both types of media content.
- Implement unit tests for local data sources: since I used a local database that I had never used before and that has a particular way of writing unit tests.
- Add the rating feature: it would be very similar to the watchlist feature but with fewer use cases since there is no screen to view the rated movies.
- Implement infinite scrolling: since BloCs are supporting pagination with the "Load More" button, all the necessary variables already exist.
